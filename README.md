# Deepfake-Detection
🕵️‍♂️ Deepfake Detection System
AI-Powered Video Deepfake Classification with Flask (ResNeXt + LSTM)

This project is an end-to-end Deepfake Video Detection System that allows users to upload or drag-and-drop a video and receive a prediction (REAL or FAKE) along with a confidence score.
It uses ResNeXt (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and LSTM (RNN) for temporal sequence analysis of video frames.

🚀 Features

🎥 Drag & Drop Video Upload

🎛 Live Video Preview Before Upload

⚡ AJAX-based Detection (No page reload)

🧠 AI Model (ResNeXt + LSTM) for Deepfake detection

👤 Face Detection using face_recognition for better accuracy

📊 Confidence score output

🎨 Modern UI with animations, neon theme, and responsive layout

🔥 Flask backend with real-time file handling

🧠 Algorithms & Technologies Used
1. ResNeXt (Deep CNN)

Extracts spatial features from each video frame

Captures textures, edges, lighting inconsistencies

Based on grouped convolutions & cardinality

Great for detecting visual artifacts in deepfakes

2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network)

Processes frames in sequence

Detects unnatural facial movements (eye blinking, head jerks, lip sync issues)

Good for temporal deepfake detection

3. Face Detection — face_recognition

Detects and crops faces from frames

Ensures the model focuses only on the important region

🛠 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deepfake-Detection.git
cd Deepfake-Detection

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask server
python server.py

4. Open in browser
http://127.0.0.1:5000

🎯 How It Works (Pipeline)

User uploads a video (drag & drop or button).

Backend extracts frames using OpenCV.

Face region is detected using face_recognition.

Frames are passed through ResNeXt → extract spatial features.

Sequence of frame features passed into LSTM → analyze motion patterns.

Output layer predicts REAL or FAKE with confidence.

Result is shown in a neon-styled UI panel.

📌 Why This Project?

Deepfakes represent one of the biggest threats in:

❗ Misinformation

❗ Political propaganda

❗ Identity fraud

❗ Cybersecurity

This system helps identify manipulated videos using AI and deep learning, making digital spaces safer.
